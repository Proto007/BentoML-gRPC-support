# Update:
Array is mostly done. Need to add support for datetime, timedelta and potentially some complex datatypes.
# BentoML-gRPC-support
This repository shows progress to extend bentoML service using gRPC.

# Progress with datatypes:
- [x] Text: Mostly done, will require some testing with different datatypes.
- [ ] NumpyNdArray: Current implementation uses BytesIO to store numpy array into bytes.
